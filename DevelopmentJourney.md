> WIP: these are just scrap words, needs modifications

Ok, let me start with a little motivation for myself.
* Current UI sucks.
* If it works, it works - isn't called 'working'.
* It's not me who's using the app, think like a user.
* Why settle for less, when a lot more can be achieved.
* Use the framework upto it's limits, if not beyond.
* Nothing is a question of how?, it's just a question of 'what' "exactly" needs to be done.
* No need to reinvent the wheel, everything's just a Google search away.
* I ain't no developer, if I can't write maintanable code.
* It's not gibberish, it's just English. Literally, just like writing an English essay, organise everything structurally and sequentially. Now, what is gibberish? Exactly, that's the point!

Well..well..well! that's enough said. This is how it's going.

Went through each and every single, little, minute corner of app. Starts noticing how much better it could/should have been. 

Nothing is aligned properly. All these days, Am I blind or whatüôÑ
Now, that justifies 1st point of my motivationüåù.

Took a pen and paper, drew roughly how better could it have been.

A proper format and font size should be followed throughout. Man, Oh man! literally there are different font sizes everywhere. Have I really been that dumb back thenüò∂. Well, atleast not anymore I guess. Or am I still ?ü•¥.
Anyway, Coming back,..that's one thing that should be changed. For god's sake, I'm sticking with 3-5 different sizes, as needed.

Why did I use all those icons, they just make it look more conjested. And they are unnecessary, atleast, not necessary.

Point Noted. Just remove them, atleast, "not necessary" ones. Done. It's one step towards better now.

The core point of Gmaterials is to download materials. And, yeah, I should say, I did a good job here(emphasis on goooood. yeah, after all the <i>motivation</i> I started with, it's kinda neededüòÖ). May be I'm not <i> that </i> dumb after all. But wait.. ** drums roll ** .. here comes a button which isn't functioning as expected. Really? Now!! Guess, that is why there are jobs specifically for testing.
> Inner me:
> What do you think all these days..that they just have lot of money to give away? You <i>dumb<i>!! (No emphasis here please üò¨)

Ok, let me admit. These ads may be, may be..again, maayyy beee..litttlleee annoying. Can understand. But, guess what? I don't get those on my device. Well, I wrote the code after all. So, I can just comment few lines and make a custom one for self. Also, on a serious note, One Admob account is blocked on the grounds of suspicious traffic as I used direct ad unit IDs instead of test ID which pojected it as if I'm doing it intentionally when I'm just testing it during development. So, that is also a reason for me to make a custom app.

Anyway, basically..it's working good. And those aren't frequent or nothing like, just pop-ups on screen. It's purely contextual and occasional. Nice!

So, no changes neede related to Ads.
